The Hebert lab at McGill university is is centered broadly around the theme of G protein-coupled signal transduction systems. 
These signalling systems are activated by agonists that bind to G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs, alternatively we use the term heptahelical receptor or 7TM-Rs) 
leading to the regulation of effector proteins (e.g. enzymes and ion channels) by a transducer. 
Some of our interests include:
1) Novel signalling complexes and pathways associated with alternative subcellular localization of GPCRs and G proteins and how they might be involved in a rare neurodevelopmental disorder, 
2) Designing and validating biosensors to track signalling events and allosteric modulation of GPCRs. 
3) Measuring such events in primary cells, inducible pluripotent stem cells, and in living animals, and 
4) Basic mechanisms of how GPCR signalling systems are wired, and the roles that these architectural features of signalling complex design might play in cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases.
